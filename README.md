# Web-Demos
This is a collection of small demonstrations exploring interesting and novel uses of modern web technology.
Each demo explores a different idea, often spawned from "what if I could..." or "how could I..."
The demos are in chronological order, in the order they were created, so most of them build off ideas and techniqes from the previous.
This was created as a way to practice and explore fun ideas focusing on the capabilities of javascript/jquery and css.
Have fun, get inspired!
